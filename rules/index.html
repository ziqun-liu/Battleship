            <h1>How to Play Battleships</h1>
            <p>This game of guessing, strategy and logical thought dates back to
                before world war one and is known the world over for being a simple 
                game that can be played with no more than a pencil and two pieces 
                of paper. It is a two player game which has since been released by 
                many board game manufacturers and its popularity can be seen through 
                not only the intricate detail now put into physical and digital 
                renditions of it, but now also in a Hollywood film based on the game.

                The player who successfully locates all their opponentâ€™s ships first
                by hitting each square they occupy is the winner as all ships have
                been destroyed.
